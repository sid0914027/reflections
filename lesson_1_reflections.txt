How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was displayed in the cmd with the proper file name

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see what was there in previous versions for corrections as such.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commits increses the usefulness of a particular version if the commit is done after every logical change or bug resolve. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is useful when files r linked and the whole system will be affected with one change. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to view the prticular commit's that were done in JS.git diff is used to differ between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   Version cotrol helps to increase the amount of risk a person can take in programming new changes as we are sure that we cant break the code and if broken will be restored to the earlier version. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use git to update my code chnges in the projects i am working on.
